2.1.0:
  - CMake-based build system and portability fixes restoring
     the ability to compile Mesquite on MS Windows.
  - Many new target metrics for volume elements
  - Target metric performance improvements
  - edge-length and area/volume metrics for use in quality assessment
  - QualityAssessor accumulates statistics for only free elements
     (elements with at least one free vertex) by default.  New
     option to revert to old behavior.
  - New command-line utilities: 
       msqshape :   run ShapeImprovementWrapper for a VTK file
       msqquality : run QualityAssessor with a few common metrics
                    for a VTK file and print results.
  - new wrappers:
       ViscousCFDTetShapeWrapper
       PaverMinEdgeLengthWrapper
  - experimental support for using iMeshP API with parallel mesquite
  
2.1.1:
  - Misc CMake build fixes
  - Support building of test suite with CMake (requires CppUnit)
  - Fix compilation error in simple_hybrid_test
  - Minor fixes to build with autotools

  - Fix (benign) compilation warnings
  - Fix portability issues (particularly Windows)
  - Fix definition of macros that might be indirectly included by
     application and conflict with application code
  - Fix bug in NodeSet class with Microsoft compiler (only affects 
      experimental smoothing of higher-order elements)
  - Fix compilation of Mesquite unit tests with latest version of CppUnit
  - Fix bug in unit test: TMPQualityMetricTest
  - Fix bug in PaverMinEdgeLengthWrapper where user-specified termination
      criteria were not used.
  - Fix tarball missing files for Windows/CMake build
  - Fix Windows DLL build issues (backport from main branch)dded
    XYPlanarDomain type
    - Updated Histogram to a more intuitive format.
    - Added Scaled Histograms feature to QualityAssessor Summary code.

  - Fix installation of documentation
  
2.1.2:
  - Fix broken support for iGeom/iRel APIs
  - Fix broken slave flag support in iMesh adaptor
  - Prefer 'c++' over 'CC' for choice of C++ compiler because 'CC' is
    not a C++ compiler on MacOS
  - Fix configure bug preventing enabling of tests for configured
    iMesh implementation
  - Fix minor build issues for tests of configured iMesh implementation

2.1.3:
  - Handle file read error cleanly in imesh test.
  - Fix iMesh test compatability
  - Fix incorrect rotation in MeshTransform utility

2.1.4:
  - Update to latest ITAPS APIs for March 2011 ITAPS release.

  - Fixed typo in header include guards reported by Jason.
  - Fixed compiler errors using gcc/g++ 4.6 on Linux, Bug 5294.
  - Fixed the errors in the MPI_DEBUG version of the check-in script on Linux.
  - Updated constructors in MsqImeshP.*pp to match those of parent class
      MsqIMesh.
  - Added parallel error handling to parallel Mesquite/VertexMover
  - Fixed std::vector not being resized after number of elements in 
      it was reduced.
  - Added Windows code to replace tmp_File() function that does not work on
      Windows 7.
